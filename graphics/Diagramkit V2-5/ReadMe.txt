DIAGRAMKIT V2.5

The image files in this kit are for the creation of large, high-quality chess diagrams. Six board backgrounds and 72 figurine pieces in 12 colours are included, as well as six templates of the game array. In addition, 108 rotated figurines in six colours are available - these are suitable for use in fairy chess problems.

To produce a diagram, use a graphics editor such as Paint.NET (not MS Paint!) that can handle the transparency of PNG files. Follow these steps to set up a position with Paint.NET (freeware available from www.getpaint.net):

1. Open a board image and the required figurines in Paint.NET. You can open multiple figurines simultaneously by selecting them in Windows Explorer and dragging the selection to the Paint.NET window.
2. The opened figurines are displayed as thumbnails in an Image List. Click on a figurine from this List, select the whole image (Ctrl-A), and copy it (Ctrl-C).
3. Switch to the board on the Image List and paste the figurine. The first time you do this, choose "Paste into a New Layer" from the Edit menu (this will create a new layer for the figurine and thus keep its background transparent). For subsequent inserts, however, a normal paste (Ctrl-V) is sufficient (because the pieces will be added to the newly created layer, which is active - see note below). 
4. Drag the figurine to the appropriate square. When the piece is released, it's enclosed by a border of the same size as one square, allowing you to centre the piece exactly on the target square. Magnify the board with the Zoom In function to help with the positioning; you can also move a piece minutely by using the keyboard's arrow keys.
5. After inserting all of the pieces, resize the image if necessary and save it in your preferred format. 

Note that the multiple-layers feature of Paint.NET allows you to keep the figurines of a diagram on a layer separate from the board. That means you can, for example, store multiple positions and boards in single file. To use this feature, open the Layers Window (press F7). After creating a new layer, you can work on its image without affecting the other layers. You can also untick the box for one layer to make it invisible. Save a diagram image in the PDN format to preserve the layering.
